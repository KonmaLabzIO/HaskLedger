**Identified problems**

- **Scalability**
    
    Scalability in the context of blockchain refers to a network's capability to handle a growing amount of transactions and smart contracts efficiently. The Plutus platform, while advanced, faces challenges in scaling to meet the increasing demand and complexity of operations on the Cardano blockchain. This limitation could potentially result in slower transaction processing times and reduced throughput, impacting the user experience and hindering the adoption of Cardano for large-scale applications.
    
    Cardano's Extended Unspent Transaction Output (EUTxO) model, though innovative, introduces concurrency issues that can complicate the development of decentralized applications (dApps). The EUTxO model restricts multiple users from interacting with a smart contract within the same block, potentially limiting the platform's scalability and efficiency in handling complex dApps.
    
- **Hardware Compatibility**
    
    The issue of hardware compatibility stems from the constraints around executing and deploying Plutus smart contracts on various hardware platforms. Given the diverse range of computing environments and Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs), some Plutus smart contracts may encounter compatibility issues, limiting their operability across different devices and systems. This problem can restrict the innovation and deployment flexibility of Cardano's blockchain applications, especially in emerging areas like IoT (Internet of Things).
    
- **Complexity in Smart Contract Development**
    
    Developing smart contracts on Plutus requires a solid understanding of Haskell and blockchain technology, presenting a significant learning curve. This complexity can act as a barrier to entry for developers new to the ecosystem or those not familiar with functional programming. The intricate nature of smart contract development on Plutus can slow innovation and deter developers from building on the Cardano blockchain.
    
- **Resource Efficiency**
    
    Resource efficiency concerns the optimization of on-chain storage and computational requirements for Plutus smart contracts. Inefficient contracts can lead to higher execution costs and slower transaction processing, negatively affecting the developer and user experience on Cardano. Optimizing smart contracts for better resource efficiency is crucial to lowering operational costs and enhancing the performance of decentralized applications (DApps).
    
- **State Management and Data Handling**
    
    Effective state management and data handling within Plutus smart contracts are crucial, especially for applications requiring complex interactions with off-chain data or maintaining intricate on-chain states. The challenge lies in managing this complexity in a way that ensures the integrity, immutability, and accessibility of data, all while optimizing for blockchain's decentralized and transparent nature.
    
- **Developer Onboarding and Tooling**
    
    The current state of developer tools, resources, and documentation for Plutus is not sufficiently comprehensive or user-friendly, making it challenging for new developers to enter the ecosystem and for existing developers to maximize their productivity. Enhancing the developer experience with better onboarding materials, debugging tools, integrated development environments (IDEs), and correctness checking can accelerate the development and deployment of applications on Cardano.
    
- **Interoperability and Integration**
    
    For wider adoption and functionality, Plutus and the broader Cardano ecosystem need to ensure seamless interaction with other systems, blockchains, and traditional financial infrastructures. Challenges in interoperability and integration can limit the potential applications and use cases for Cardano, restricting its ability to interact with and leverage external data sources, services, and platforms.
    
- **Infrastructure Gaps**
    
    **Limited Throughput**
    
    Despite improvements and the introduction of scalability solutions like Hydra, Cardano currently faces limitations in transaction throughput. With the network handling only a fraction of the transactions per second compared to some of its peers, there's a significant gap in its ability to support high-volume, real-time applications.
    
    **Finality and Consensus Mechanism**
    
    Cardano's Ouroboros consensus mechanism, while providing a more energy-efficient alternative to traditional Proof of Work (PoW) systems, does not offer absolute finality. This probabilistic finality could pose risks for certain transaction types or financial services requiring guaranteed settlement.
    
    **Blockchain Layer Problems**
    
    Cardano's multi-layer architecture, designed to separate the settlement layer from the computational layer, adds complexity and potential friction in the development and deployment of smart contracts and dApps. While this separation aims to enhance scalability and flexibility, it also requires developers to navigate additional complexities, possibly hindering innovation and adoption.
